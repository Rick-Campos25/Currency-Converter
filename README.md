This is a simple Currency Converter application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python. It allows users to convert a specified amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates via a free currency conversion API.

Libraries Used:
- tkinter (for the GUI interface)
- requests (for making API calls to retrieve exchange rates)
- json (to parse API responses)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library - to display app icon)
